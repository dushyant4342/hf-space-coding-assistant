# For CPU-only: torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# For Quantization
bitsandbytes>=0.42.0 
#pip install -U bitsandbytes

# bitsandbytes is primarily for NVIDIA GPUs. CPU support is experimental or might require specific builds/compilations.
# If you encounter issues with bitsandbytes on CPU, you might need to remove it and load the model without quantization,
# or find a CPU-specific quantization library.
